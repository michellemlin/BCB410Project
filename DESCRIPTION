Description: ClinicalTranscriptLink is a package that aims to identify correlations between 
    clinical expression of cancers and the transcriptional expression using bulk 
    RNA sequencing data in the TCGA database. Packages currently available only study one of these and 
    do not provide any correlation between the clinical expression of diseases and 
    the corresponding gene expression. As such, this package aims to create that 
    link to help us better understand the relation.
